Each firm launches products to succeed,
but some of them fail instantly,
while some lose their sheen early,
some of them stay for a while,
but few succeed to leave indelible mark on the people's mind.

So, what's the pressure point,
what makes people go frenzy for few,
and leave others aside.

Your challenge is to rebrand those many,
either from past or from present,
or to conceive, altogether a new product,
and communicate, and convey your ideas effectively.

Event is of two rounds:
FIRST : Pearls from the Present & Past.
SECOND : Foot in the future.
