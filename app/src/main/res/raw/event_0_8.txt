It's a 3 member team task.

It's a coding extravaganza.

There will be 3 questions for each team which needs to be solved with equal contribution from all the 3 members.

There will be total 4 timing slots of 15, 10, 10 and 15 minutes, you will have to solve all the three questions which will be continuously swapped among the team members.
Questions will be displayed only in the first slot, for the rest slots it's your teammate's responsibility to leave a hint of the work to be done.
